## Good and Evil

## VaR and Stress Tests

- VaR: Value at Risk (when the a isn't capitalized)
  - Invented after the stock market crash of 1987
  - VaR is quoted in dollars for a given probability and a time-horizon.
  - It is a measure to quantify risk.

- Stress Test
  - Invented after the 2007-09 crash
  - It's a method of assessing risks to firms or portfolios. Looking at the details of the portfolio and question about its vulnerabilities for crisis.
  - Ordered by the government, to see how a firm will stand up to a financial crisis
  - Examples: Liquid shortage, dollar variations, sudden crash.
  - Has big critics, even some that had successful stress tests failed, like the FreddieMac.
  - Some companies will try to whitewash it, to no damage their image and business.

## S&P 500

- It's used as a benchmark for returns. Imagine if you had invested in the whole market, it is reflected in the graph
- It's the average of 500 stocks. Stocks are dependent of each other, because the law of large numbers looks like it doesn't apply.
- $\beta$
  - The beta of a stock is a measure of how it relates to the stock market.
- Market risk vs. Idiosyncratic Risk
  - The variance of return in a stock
  
     $varstock = \betaÂ²*marketvar + residualvar$
  - The residual is the non fitting stock behavior vs. the average. (Company did well in the day and S&P poorly.)
  - The market variance is the normal market variation.

## Distribution and Outliers

- Outliers and shock events exists in the financial market. It can be reflected by cauchy (fat tail).

----

## Covariance

- If the covariance is zero between stock patterns, the companies are a independent investment.
- If it is positive, they correlate in some way.
- Being negative, if one succeeds, the other will decrease in value.

- Think about the covariance in your investments. Because, if you invest in a only one type of company, you will be susceptible to huge variations and crashes.

- Idiosyncratic risk just doesn't matter.
It all averages out. But not having a pulverized portfolio is dangerous.

- The CAPM model is not unanimous, but is a good first step.

## Insurance

- Is normally a contract which a policyholder has to give a premium if certain well-defined risks happen, with the condition of regular payment.
- Risk pooling is the source of all value in insurance.
- If the policies are independent, by the law of large numbers it tends to zero risk.
- Moral Hazard dealt partially by deductions and co-insurance.
- Selection Bias dealt with by group policies, by testing referrals, and by mandatory government insurance.
- Began at Rome but with a narrow focus.
- Thus insurance policies appeared in Italy in 14th century, with fast expansion in 1600s with probability.
- Agency theory in 1840's NY
- Psychological framing, 1880's with large cash value
- Life insurance is a relic when people died young.
- Early it felt like betting in a loved one's life. Which made a part of the early resistance.
