# 4th Week - Neural Networks Basics

## Deep Neural Networks


- What is a deep neural network?
  - It is possbile to notice the layers in a Neural Network. With few layers like 1 or 2 the NN is shallow, but with 4 or more is a deep NN.
  - We don't count the input layer, only the hidden layers and the output model.
  - Normally, more layers, the better the model.

- Why deep representations?
  - Imagine that each layer is trying to process something.
  - For Example: Face Recognition
    - The first layer tries to get the edges
    - The Second Layer is trying to find the features of the face
    - The Third layer is trying to form the face
  - These kind of processes (simple to complex) in NNs occurs in many kinds of problems
