# 4th Week - Neural Networks Basics

## Deep Neural Networks


- What is a deep neural network?
  - It is possbile to notice the layers in a Neural Network. With few layers like 1 or 2 the NN is shallow, but with 4 or more is a deep NN.
  - We don't count the input layer, only the hidden layers and the output model.
  - Normally, more layers, the better the model.
